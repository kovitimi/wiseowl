# wiseowl

This is an attempt to build a smart talking computer ( specially for my daughter who is obsessed with owls, hence the name ), 
to inspire her and other kids what is possible now with ubiquitous computing made possible by Rasberry PI and open source software like 
CMU Sphinx. 

I will keep improving this incrementally and will be always open source.
